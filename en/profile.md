## About Me

- I'm an engineer based in Hangzhou, China, specializing in front-end development, with some experience in Swift, Rust, Python, and a bit of design.
- I'm a fan of open-source culture and not keen on the tech influencer scene. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and am a strong believer in long-termism.
- I have a passion for creating products that are simple, beautiful, and user-friendly. I've worked on developer tools and AI workflows at CodeCodex.
- My blog [**CodeCodex**](https://jascenn.github.io/), is where I share insights on AI coding, productivity, and engineering.
